                    Lace is a recurring boss in Hollow Knight: Silksong.

                    Lace makes two appearances in two different arenas in the reveal trailer as an antagonist. 
                    In the first trailer appearance Lace and Hornet battle in a dark arena on a bed of white roses with massive pipes trailing in the background. A big golden cage is also present in the centre of the arena. 
                    Lace does a swipe up with her "Gilded Pin" over Hornet's head before propelling herself down at an angle with a midair jab. The second trailer appearance is very brief as for a second Lace is shown to be wildly swiping and dashing around mid-air as if in some sort of frenzy. 
                    The new setting is also on a metal platform over a pool of lava. The second appearance over the lava lake was revealed to be Hornet's first encounter with Lace during the game.

                    The Bell Beast is an upcoming enemy, NPC, and possible boss in Hollow Knight: Silksong. 
                    
                    She was first seen in the Silksong reveal trailer. The Bell Beast appears to be the main method of fast travel throughout Pharloom. She is initially found in the Marrow, where she is trapped in Silk. 
                    Once the Bell Beast is freed, she attacks Hornet. After her defeat, she flees to another area.[1]
                    At some later point she is tamed in which she definitively adopts the position as the fast travel system.
